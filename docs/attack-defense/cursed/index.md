# Cursed A/D Tactics

<span class=hltext>We do not endorse taking advantage of loopholes that make
the game unfair, even when the rules of the competition allow it.</span>

The purpose of this section is to raise awareness among organizers, and help
build CTFs in a way that abusing such tactics is not practical.
