# Team Inflation

<span class=hltext>Similar to [flag farming](flag-farming.md), team inflation
involves registering multiple fake teams, but instead of submitting their
flags, the offending team uses them to influence the value of their own exploits.</span>

Some scoring formulas, such as [SaarCTF2024](../scoring/saarctf2024.md) and
[ATKLABv2](../scoring/atklabv2.md), try to estimate the number of active teams
to calculate the defense value of patches. This can be abused by turning
services (or VPN connections) on or off depending on whether the offending
team is currently being attacked or not.
