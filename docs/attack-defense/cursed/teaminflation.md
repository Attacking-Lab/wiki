# Team Inflation

<span class=hltext>Similar to [flag teams](flagteams.md), team inflation
involves registering multiple fake teams, but instead of submitting their
flags, the offending team uses them to influence the value of their own exploits.</span>

Some scoring formulas, such as [SaarCTF2024](../scoring/saarctf2024.md) and
[ATKLABv2](../scoring/atklabv2.md), try to estimate the number of active teams.
This can be abused by turning services (or VPN connections) on or off depending
on whether the offending team is currently exploiting or not to increase the
value of their exploit / reduce the value of others.
