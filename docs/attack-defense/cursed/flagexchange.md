# Flag Exchange

<span class=hltext>Flag exchange is a type of *flag sharing*, where the teams
involved agree to share flags under the condition that every team receives
every one else's flag.</span>

This condition makes the tactic attractive even among competitors, as long
as the parties involved believe competing against each other teams is
easier than against the teams flags are not being shared with.

Collaborating teams may even share the credentials for flag-holding users on
their services to enable exfiltration over the game network, making the
misconduct less obvious.
