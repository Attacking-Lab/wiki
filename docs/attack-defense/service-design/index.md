# Service Design

Just a few key aspects can greatly impact player experience for an A/D service.

Based on our experience playing and hosting Attack-Defense competitions, we
define [a set of minimum requirements](tenets.md) for evaluating A/D service
quality.

We share insights from our mistakes by highlighting some of
the common [pitfalls](pitfalls.md) encountered by authors during
service development and how to avoid them.
