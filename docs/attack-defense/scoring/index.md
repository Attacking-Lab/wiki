# Attack-Defense Scoring Formula

A scoring formula computes each team's rank from the number of flags captured,
the number of exploits prevented (expressed as the number of own flags not captured) and the availability
of their services to the checker.

The ideal scoring formula **ensures a team's rank accurately reflects their
effort and skill**, while incentivizing competitiveness and interaction
between teams throughout the CTF.

To evaluate and compare scoring formulas[^1] against each other, we utilize
[a set of tenets](tenets.md) derived from our own experience. Finally, we
contribute our own scoring formulas, which attempt to fulfill all of our criteria.
