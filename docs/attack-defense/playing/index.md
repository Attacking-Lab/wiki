- preparing infrastructure for [monitoring](/attack-defense/playing/monitoring.md) and [exploit automation](/attack-defense/playing/exploiting.md)
- formulating an [attack strategy](/attack-defense/playing/strategy.md)
- working effectively as a team

Depending on what is provided by the organizers, you might
have to host your own vulnbox.
