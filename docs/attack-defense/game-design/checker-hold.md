# Checker Hold

A **checker hold** is a period of time during each tick that no tasks are
being processed by the checker, and thus no connections are open to the
teams' services that might be interrupted by a restart.

The motivation for a time window with no traffic comes from the fact that some
[scoring formulas](/attack-defense/scoring-formula/index.md) rely on large SLA
for disincentivizing metagame tactics. This puts a large burden on players who
patch their service, since they risk losing one round of SLAâ€”or more if flags
could not be placed due to the downtime.

Since checker task scheduling is unpredictable by design, patching without
a guarantee is inherently unfair and does not properly measure skill.

In practice, the number of game rounds far exceeds the number of rounds of SLA
a team would lose due to patching. Since all teams are equally subject
to the randomness of the checker, it only needs to be considered for
high-stakes competitions.
