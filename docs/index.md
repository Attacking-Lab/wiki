# Attacking-Lab Wiki

Welcome to the **Attacking-Lab Wiki**.


**Attacking-Lab** is the result of an ongoing collaboration between CTF players
from [ENOFLAG](https://ctftime.org/team/1438/),
[FAUST](https://ctftime.org/team/550),
[FluxFingers](https://ctftime.org/team/551/),
[organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934/),
and [saarsec](https://ctftime.org/team/15337)
to organize high-quality [Attack-Defense CTFs](/attack-defense/index.md).


Learning from our own experiences [playing](/attack-defense/playing/index.md)
and [organizing](/attack-defense/hosting/index.md) A/D CTFs, we:

1. value high reliability, performant infrastructure and extensive monitoring
2. treat all teams equally, indpendent of their players and personal connections
3. build problems that actually test practical knowledge and problem-solving
4. implement enforcable rules and react quickly to misconduct

Our tooling is generally [open-source](https://github.com/attacking-lab).
